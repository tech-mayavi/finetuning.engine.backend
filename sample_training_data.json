    "input": "",
    "output": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain neural networks",
    "output": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information and learn patterns from data."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How do you train a model?",
    "input": "For supervised learning",
    "output": "To train a supervised learning model: 1) Prepare labeled training data, 2) Choose an appropriate algorithm, 3) Feed data to the model, 4) Adjust parameters to minimize error, 5) Validate performance on test data."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is overfitting?",
    "output": "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Define deep learning",
    "output": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, enabling complex pattern recognition."
